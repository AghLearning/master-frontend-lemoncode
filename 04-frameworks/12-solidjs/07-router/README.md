# 06 Router

In this example we will use the `Solid Router` to navigate between pages. You can find the official documentation [here](https://docs.solidjs.com/guides/how-to-guides/routing-in-solid/solid-router).

We will start from `06-store`.

## Steps to build it

`npm install` to install previous example packages:

```bash
npm install
```

## Install the router package

```bash
npm install @solidjs/router
```
